For this project, I was interested in using the data to understand the following:
1. do household income influence store revenue.
2. which sales channel had the highest profit.
3. which region had the highest profit.
4. who is the most valuable customer and product.
5. average household income by location.

### Findings
1. Sales Channel: Of the four sales channels, In-Store accounts for 41.25%, Online 29.47%, Distributor 17.91%, and Wholesale 11.38%. This indicates that the preferred mode of shopping by the locals is buying directly from the store.
2. Regional Profit: There are four regions accounted for in this analysis, West 35.37%, South 31.72%, Midwest 21.31%, and Northeast 11.6%. Population played a major factor in profit made by the different regions, West with the highest population of 33 million accounted for 35.37% of total profit, and the Northeast with a population of 27 million made the lowest profit.
3. Household Income by Location Type: One would think that with the highest average household income with a large population, a location should be making large sales and making a profit. But that is not the case with Borough, a location with the highest average household income of $616,413 and a population of $9 million, had total sales of $1 million and a profit of $410.7k, the lowest for a location type with such a population. Township with the second lowest average household income and a population of 4 million had the second highest total sale of $7 million and profit of $2.81 million after City (avg. household income $109,638, population 90 million, total sales $67 million, profit $24.77 million).
## Recommendations:
Based on the analysis, some locations like the Borough are not functioning to full capacity given the large population. The sales team needs to embark on a vigorous campaign and also review the prices in their stores.
